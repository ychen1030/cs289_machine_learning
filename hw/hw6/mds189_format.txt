I recommend opening one <movement>.json label with https://jsoneditoronline.org/
You can navigate to that website, and drag and drop a label file in the left
panel. On the right panel, you'll be able to view different key's values with
a convenient drop-down. I recommend opening a JSON there BEFORE reading through
the structure below. This way, you can compare what you see in the online editor
to the descriptions below.

The <movement>.json label files have the following broad structure:
'pseudo_gt_raw' : Per frame detected keypoints results, using OpenPose
  '/frames'       : list of frame indices. You can compare these with the
                    labeled left/right 'frame' labels (see field below) to see
                    frames for one side of the movement.
  '/num_people'   : list of count of number of people per frame.
  '/2d_keypoints' : list of list of lists of keypoints. The outer list
                    corresponds to frame number. The middle list corresponds
                    to people in a frame. The inner-most list corresponds to the
                    keypoints themselves. The keypoints lists are 75 dimensions.
  '/bbox'         : list of list of lists of bounding boxes. The outer list
                    corresponds to frame number. The middle list corresponds
                    to people in a frame. The inner-most list corresponds to the
                    bounding themselves. The bounding boxes are computed from
                    the keypoints. They are: [xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax] format.
'gt_pose_dict'  : Raw dictionary output from LabelBox
  '/left'  : left key frame keypoints
  '/right' : right key frame keypoints
'gt_pose'       : LabelBox keypoints in a list, processed from 'gt_pose_dict'
                  Some students labeled several keypoints for one body joint,
                  however, there should only be one keypoint per body joint.
                  These lists are formed from taking the *last* keypoint labeled
                  for each body joint.
  '/left'  : left key frame keypoints, 75 dimensions
  '/right' : right key frame keypoints, 75 dimensions
'gt_pose_align' : LabelBox keypoints aligned with corresponding (i.e., same
                  movement) heatherlckwd keypoints. These are also lists with
                  the same format as 'gt_pose'
  '/left'  : left key frame keypoints, 75 dimensions
  '/right' : right key frame keypoints, 75 dimensions
'frames'        : left and right movement start, end, key frames
  '/left'
    '/f_start'  : start frame, zero-indexed (not one-indexed as it was in HW5!)
    '/f_end'    : end frame, zero-indexed (not one-indexed as it was in HW5!)
    '/f_key'    : key frame, zero-indexed (not one-indexed as it was in HW5!)
    '/filename' : 'key_frames/<movement label>_left.jpg'. You shouldn't need
                  to use this field.
  '/right'
    '/f_start'  : start frame, zero-indexed (not one-indexed as it was in HW5!)
    '/f_end'    : end frame, zero-indexed (not one-indexed as it was in HW5!)
    '/f_key'    : key frame, zero-indexed (not one-indexed as it was in HW5!)
    '/filename' : 'key_frames/<movement label>_left.jpg'. You shouldn't need
                  to use this field.
'movement'      : similar movement data to JSONs you labeled in HW5
  '/f_start'   : zero-indexed start frame of movement (you labeled these in HW5)
  '/f_end'     : zero-indexed end frame of movement (you labeled these in HW5)
  '/bilateral' : boolean indicating whether the movement is bilateral or not
  '/label'     : label \in {'reach','squat','inline','lunge','hamstrings',
                            'stretch','deadbug','pushup'}
'metadata'      : image, video size, fps, and frame count details
  'width'              : key frame width, in original size
  'height'             : key frame height, in original size
  'video_width'        : downloaded video width, i.e., this is the width of
                         video frames extracted from the video downloaded using
                         your provided YouTube links in HW5
  'video_height'       : downloaded video height, i.e., this is the height of
                         video frames extracted from the video downloaded using
                         your provided YouTube links in HW5
  'video_width_scale'  : all frames are resized to 224x448. This is the
                         x-coordinate scale factor to multiply with keypoint
                         annotations so they match up with the resized images.
  'video_height_scale' : all frames are resized to 224x448. This is the
                         y-coordinate scale factor to multiply with keypoint
                         annotations so they match up with the resized images.
  'number_frames'      : number of frames in the original video
  'fps'                : frame rate
  'video_scale'        : ignore this field. I forgot to delete it for you
                         before uploading the data to Google drive :(

The keypoint lists, which are 75 in length have the format:
[joint 0 x-coordinate, joint 0 y-coordinate, joint 0 logit,
 joint 1 x-coordinate, joint 1 y-coordinate, joint 1 logit,
 .
 .
 .
 joint 24 x-coordinate, joint 24 y-coordinate, joint 24 logit]
For ground truth keypoints the logit is either 0 or 1, corresponding to whether
a point was labeled or not. For OpenPose keypoints, the logit is >= 0, and
roughly corresponds to the network's confidence on the keypoint location.
The order of the keypoints is:
['Nose',
 'Neck',
 'RShoulder',
 'RElbow',
 'RWrist',
 'LShoulder',
 'LElbow',
 'LWrist',
 'MidHip',
 'RHip',
 'RKnee',
 'RAnkle',
 'LHip',
 'LKnee',
 'LAnkle',
 'REye',
 'LEye',
 'REar',
 'LEar',
 'LBigToe',
 'LSmallToe',
 'LHeel',
 'RBigToe',
 'RSmallToe',
 'RHeel']
